# Quantity-Calculator
This calculator is meant to accomplish three things:
1. Measure quantity in grams of disimilar product types.
2. Convert product weight in accordance with product type.
3. Supply a definitive go/no-go prompt for legal sale.

This calculation is necessary as different products carry a different concentration of chemicals.
Legal limits dictate an overall quantity allowance per purchase with severe penalization.

Products should be entered in their corresponding categories with the manufacturer supplied weight from the label.
